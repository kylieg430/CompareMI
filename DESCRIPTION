Description: Compares denoising autoencoder and multiple imputation chained equations (MICE) methods for multiple imputation. It allows you to simulate a surivival dataset and then for the analyses any sample size can be used because Plasmode Simulations are used to sample from the data to construct a new dataset of any size. The methods can be compared using RMSE and can be compared using more clinically relevant measures. The user can choose to analyze MCAR,MAR,or MNAR.
